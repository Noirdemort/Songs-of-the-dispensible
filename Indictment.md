. Like a jewel to the crown
Fastened still,
Of lores and legends it confabulated
the word was never said,
Do gods always protect good?
Does truth comes in same shape, size and box?

The life takes silhouette,
The banal dictates the stale rules,
Land, skies or oceans,
Is life archaic already?
Is there nothing further?

Much above the land,
Half way below the zenith,
A haven precipitates,
Unbeknownst to the mortal,
The golden cuff they endow it
Of benign & beast it confesses of

Predisposed to anchor life,
Awaiting to boil over the simmering bowl,
And so it harbours the reaper,
And everything in between

Nothing alive ever roams there,
The ghosts just like to make up stories amongst them
