Novelty is the underpinning of an alive pulsating being. Idiosyncrasies that set us apart cater to fancies of select few - exclusivity and taste often form the underpinnings of such eccentricities. We connect to others via our common humanity (and some may even dare to say banalities) but our deepest relationships incur our will to courage. 
However, the rosy picture I paint veils a seething indictment - an excessive sense of criticism.  Falling for novelty pre-requisites a rejection of majority - it can be the average consensus or personal inclination - however, it is not a litmus test of better or worse, just different. My selection of green presage emerges from the exclusive solitude, a sense of focus and a perceptive vision - it reflects parts of me - sublime yet expressive - demand immense attention and patience on part of my interlocutor.  While all good things shall come to an end, the best ones are tailored and crafted. 
The question of legacy is one of hubris and often met with a brush-off and a chuckle - yet it is an overwhelming overtone of swathes of actions not just as individual but thoroughly as a species. It is an incredible part for being human. The quest for life extraordinaire is a trope itself questionable!
