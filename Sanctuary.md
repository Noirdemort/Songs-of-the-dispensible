Time is a phoney foe
slave to flesh of void,
Tap of a step 
and another one 
to never be heard,
it envies the humming bird.

Egregious, frazzled and taciturn,
I wash out
drowning down rumbling torrent
dreaming river,
I become more of myself
and less of me remains
I banquet the dark
for my soul is the vessel,
I scavenge in light
for too many of them wander 'aright'.

I leave clocks forsaken
and demolish the clocktower,
Shun a taboo
unwary of time
unaware of its bearings,
I weather it,
a velvet voyage
the vistas unfashioned.

Time is a phoney foe
slave to flesh of void,
Tap of a step 
and another one 
to never be heard,
I envy the humming bird
dreaming of river,
Too many of them wander in light,
scavenging 
their clocks aright,
unwary of time
I weather it,
a velvet voyage
a many a vistas unfashioned.
