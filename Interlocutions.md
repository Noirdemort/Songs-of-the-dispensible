What sense had I offer stolen hours of lust?
What sense had I of her stolen hours of lust?
I saw it not,
I thought it not,
And it harmed not me.
I fell not Casio’s kisses on her lips.
I slept the next night well, I fed well, and was free and merry



Had it pleased heaven To try me with affliction; had they rain'd All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head. Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips, Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes, I should have found in some place of my soul A drop of patience….

But there where I have garnered up my heart,
Where either I must live or bear no life

It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me. O my soul's joy! If after every tempest come such calms, May the winds blow till they have waken'd death! And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas Olympus-high and duck again as low As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die, it were now to be most happy; for, I fear, My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate.

You speak an infinite deal of nothing.

My tongue will tell the anger of my heart. Or else my heart concealing it will break.

Stars hide your fires; let not light see my black and deep desires.

The quality of mercy

The last refuge of the insomniac is a sense of superiority to the sleeping world

Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash.
I couldn’t feel so I learned to touch.

Poetry is a verdict rather than an intention.

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in.

How can I begin anything new with all of yesterday in me?

Children show scars like medals. Lovers use them as a secrets to reveal. A scar is what happens when the word is made flesh.

You go your way
I'll go your way too

Here's to the few who forgive what you do, and the fewer who don't even care

I have tried in my way to be free.

first of all nothing will happen and a little later nothing will happen again

Do not be a magician - be magic!

We are not mad. We are human. We want to love, and someone must forgive us for the paths we take to love, for the paths are many and dark, and we are ardent and cruel in our journey.
- I often am made to revisit these lines by Leonard Cohen. I have had my callous moments too... at times maybe we all do. At the end of day, to accept and be accepted is often what we seek; to be celebrated and heard; and to be good enough for someone we admire and adore cluelessly and senselessly.

a kite is a victim you are sure of. you love it because it pulls.

It's hard to hold the hand of anyone who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

Anything I tell you is an alibi for something else. Then let's be quiet together.

Love is a fire/It burns everyone/It disfigures everyone/It is the world's excuse for being ugly.

Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win 
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline

We are all going to have to learn to live without the comforting lies we whisper to ourselves in the darkness of our minds.

“If you want a lover I'll do anything you ask.

If you want a different kind of love I'll wear a mask.

If you want to strike me down in anger here I stand.

If you want a partner in life take my hand.

I'm your man.” 

“Silence

And a deeper silence

When the crickets

Hesitate”

“My page was too white
My ink was too thin
The day wouldn't write
What the night pencilled in”
