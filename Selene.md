# Chapter - Confrontation

Hearts and twigs shiver,
The trunks sway,
A sky thrashes,
in a dichotomy of palettes.

Imposing cobalt decrees,
threatening despair,
Exuberant Pink revolts,
serene and still,

Above heads,
covert,
a tryst of dualities conspire.


# Chapter - Hope

Impervious to prophecies,
A rebellion realizes,

Assertive winds,
Desire,
Unfazed courage,

Stark grey brims and quells,
Inebriated pink shades canvas.


# Chapter - Ignorance

Is it just us?
Or nature too, crusades?
Do leaves testify to sunlight?
If the stellar solace in seclusion?

Premonitions and mirages
plague sight and vision,
Perched above trodden grass,
I wonder.

A stoic, a nihilist or a romantic,
All disguises curiosity conjures?
Or muses of a cynic, an iconoclast or a skeptic ?


# Chapter - Dissent

A cold gust,
The poisoned yew,

"Foolish, Deceived or poisoned?", 
indicts the snake slithering,
Prejudiced for and by
Crest and trough of petty affairs.

All eventualities but a moment,
A droplet of time,
Lost to itself,
To undead,
Extinct.


# Chapter - Smoke and Mirrors

Trance shatters to an incessant buzz,
The bumblebee bellows and waddles,
Galavanting from a flower to another,
Oblivious to such indulgences?
Or indifferent?

Light recedes,
Encircling clouds and chilly breeze,
A canvas too close to comprehend,
I contemplate retreat.

Witnessing the stellar prevail,
I turn to my hot cocoa,
Wary of flashes and tilted wills,
A sharp night ensues.
