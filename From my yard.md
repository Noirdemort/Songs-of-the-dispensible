A simple house sparrow
chirps the songs of spring,
A haunt of still winter dew, 
dallies over her wing,
A hard shrug and a light flap,
she perches on the steep ledge.

From one lazy afternoon to another
I revel to her daily pother,
echoing through my yard,
as she troubles a little bard.

I doze to the knock of evening,
a trance broken by a bitter breeze
Ruffling through my hair.
