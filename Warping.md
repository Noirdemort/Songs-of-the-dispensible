A burst of light
and foreshadows,
Scattered hopes,
barren meadows,
Cosmos transfixed
with its potential,
infinite branches
yet a reality unreal.

A force warps time,
engulfing possibilities,
consuming infinite to one,
a writhing heart
gallops in fear,
for freedom in vain,
The tip of spear,
burns the torment
of a thousand limbos.

The gravity collapses
the eternal maze,
Sentience forms the scathing reality
For the dream ceases to exist.

And thus time is born
for the distance to crumble.
