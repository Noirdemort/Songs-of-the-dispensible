Unreal

Make and Believe 

Flesh, blood and bones,
the marrow trickling,
A curtain of beige tones,
senses of flimsy fickle flings,
At mercy of clocks
and vices,

A constricting boa senses the pumping heart,
yet a lover moves on,

I juggle masks, lies and contorted facts,
inventing reality,
to cloak over me,
and anticipate another.
