Treacherous haven, 
Callous desertion,
To their nilly-willy parade,
I sing elated or drown in despair,
For my lover has dictated them.

Words of such fickle nature,
weave the song of life,
Forsaken lies the moment,
I devour and hanker for more,
Seeking solace in a curtain of connected dots,
Even the screen turns to smoke. 

The crow caws the cacophony,
Baffled I deliberate,
Brooding over its meaning, 
or the lack of it,
Rushing to ascribe,
To quell a tumultuous mind.

The rat race,
Folly is the praise, 
Hollow the play,
The lark hums now,
the note is the truth,
Melody a present
I shake the dust of words,
And turn to crimson hue.

For a Rome may hail,
And a Rome may perish,
I am and the now,
Remnant, a memory or to be perish.
