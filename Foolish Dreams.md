I want to reminisce,
moments and memories made-up
The mirage crumbles
in a fell swoop
You and I,
what and why,
How do we end up together?

They say
I need to let go,
to care little and less
of songs of us,
the promise of tomorrow
and I defy them,
for us
to cling,
to not let go
of my Foolish dreams

I wonder at sky,
from clouds above,
stealing glances from the aisle,
looking at a world discovered
that denies the reality the I know,
the truth I swear by

A world apart
of stories old,
I imagine stories of us,
requiem half-unwritten 
for abandoned dreams

They demand of me
to give up
to break the slumber
the ideas of a love eternal
the hope of swaying to the music together
hand in hand
just the two of us
and no one for miles

but I defy them all
to sing and dance
to celebrate our
Foolish Dreams

Foolish Dreams - x3

And now the breeze bellows,
leaving shattered shreds
all over the place,
of your Foolish Dreams

And I await you
to put it all back together
to take the leap of faith
So I can live again these Foolish Dreams
while I live this one more Foolish Dream
