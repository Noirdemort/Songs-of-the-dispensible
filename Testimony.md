The wind blew strong
yet his eyes remained fixated,
I requested a testimony
but he gazed inebriated,
His lips shut as if sewn
and he smiled with his eyes,
I tried to peek past him
but it was all a blur.
I enquired around with a glance,
a scattering of dry shrubs,
a few trees,
 a large one to his left,
a pond further to the right,
a turban he rocked,
crimson, pearl and flecks of emerald,
his face tanned,
the shades of teak,
He exuded a darkness,
palpable under the scorching sun,
unknown to blue skies,

I enquired him of fate,
he peered into my eyes,
the wind dropped its pace and stood still,
I felt a staunch,
the abyss of burning heart,
the decay of time,
the friction of his struggles
and his fears.
Rattled I stood, hollowed I cried,
no sound was inspired
yet birds and beasts petrified.
Relieved I sighed and broke the sweat,
I demanded, “Who’s next?”
Ignoramus he turned,
whisking away,
so I demanded again with conviction of Olympus

He halted his tracks,
He shattered the serene and mumbled,
He conveyed to wind in whispers,
and decreed, “Everyone.”

“What about you?”, I proposed

“I am shadow of a story,
and like all of them,
I will conclude, hopefully”
He sighed despair, and anticipated destiny.
