Light shattered through the prism,
and so did the hopes kindled
from our walks together.
I returned the half
of broken pearl,
yet it never moved from its past.

What err did I wander into?

Are the pieces of my dream
not enough to mend it?
Of emeralds I concur,
but what of my heart?
Shouldn’t the shards when reclaimed
melt into whole?

An affinity (or a bond?) among the broken
The Lost World
No way to reclaim it
No lore to reminisce by

Colors exploded into art and blinded the eyes,
Music broke into melody and deafened the ears,
Memories of us flashed ecstatic
and drowned me in sorrow,
for you and me were there
but “we” did not attend the carnival.

A silence (prayer) for the moment abandoned,
The Lost world
No legend to stride through
No soul to recollect by

Lost world
A Lost world
The lost world
