[IMG_2231](A developing sky)

The breeze picked up. The wind ran sharp, whooshing among objects and surfaces. It grew colder, a light drizzle followed making one gravitate towards warmth. 

The cloudy sky flaunted shades of blue, someone toppled a bottle of ink leaving blotches of dark and light throughout stratos. Thunder violated the zenith faraway.

"Who has made Zeus angry now? Probably, it's Kratos." 

The blue of the horizon incited love, the unrequited sort.

The distinction between hope and desire became more lucid. What can be chained to word is desire, and what can't be, but be intricately yearned for every moment or other, is Hope.

The sky, indulged itself into its many mischiefs. It tumbled around with a gust of wind, revealed the azure behind the stained canvas, and revelled in itself. The Horizon, like an alchemist, went about its exploration.

One could only hope to imagine if something as discernibly immortal, as the blue dome would have any hopes or desires. If it should have any.

The pink of the setting Sun waded through, at a distance instigating one's childish craving to search for skeuomorphic abstractions in the snow-white shrouds.

The spilling dark of the sky continued to blemish rest of the patches. Soon, the dark titanium started to take over, concealed conspiracies and confabulations between Zeus and his table. 

Leaving the world to be desolate and privy to wonder at its far away celestials, the sun took leave from the sky and the night raged on. 

Zeus continued his memoirs and the cosmos, unaware, kept turning to the rhythms of its own.

Among immortals, the world seemed unspirited, stodgy and uninspired.

For mortals, they were content with wondering and moving on. The next one came and did the same. Each one with no reminiscence of the past. 

"Such folly!", thought Zeus.
