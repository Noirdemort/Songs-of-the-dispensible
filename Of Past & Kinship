Laments the wistful lark
a song of melancholy,
The abandoned souvenirs
Transcend the cursed anchor
and resurrect the drownings binds

On endless fall
Searched the vestiges of belonging I hath
the ashen remains of an abstract longing
A kinship forged
in search of imagined comfort
the wreak of forsaking time (which has abandoned me)

What of all that I forgot and remember,
The stories lost and told?

the girl, the place and the longing - the belonging
quiet

Laments the lost lark
a song of melancholy,
The barreling spiral
An endless roll,
Memories lost and forged,
Stories forgotten and told,
Murk a drifting spirit
Veiling the mirage of truth.

Smokes and mirrors
the figment of belonging,
The ashen remains
Of kinship manufactured,
Derived to the word
from a souvenir’s anchor.

The ruse relief
Of a pang mundane,
A glint of past
hopes so tamed,
Shattered to hushed enquiry
Of promises never made.

“Why thee act?”
Pounded an indictment to the spirit,
To what end exist
these affairs fashioned?
An imposing quiet
Dawns over the ocean’s flare.

Such a beautiful glamorous world,
for the sore eyes harboured no sight!
