I broke my chains
yet I am not free,
I incinerated my cage
but the bars still linger on,
I escaped the beast
while I fall prey to it everyday,
I exhausted my words
yet the unfreedom yearns articulation.
I sketched and sang my desired,
but a strife remains to be distilled,
I conquered Rome and the beyond
still my world feels drained.

What is the doom
that we hanker for?
What is this freedom
that I yearn for?
What will set me free
from my broken bondages?
What amusement will bare the epiphany!

The ring I bear,
The wand I brandish,
The book I recite,
they bear the labor of my torment,
the questions I chase
echo back an abyss.

Wondering, wandering and walking
I meander my time
in quest of true liberty.
