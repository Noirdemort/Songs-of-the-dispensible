The hope
The genesis 
The pilgrimage
The interludes amidst 
The coda
The attainment,
I docketed to proprieties of mine,

A thousand steps, a million and not even one
Me, an ant and the time,
We eloped the same stretch.

I galloped the hamster wheel,
he sat still amused
and death I divined.

The living embers of relics
scattered to zephyr
smeared traces on my face,
A ray of light trespassed meditations,
left its splinters to cavalcade through the prism,
for mortals to chase
and wonder.

A buzzing bee laid bare beside,
The butterfly abandoned awaiting spring,
I decided to rest 
at the bench a feet afar,
and the hamster lurched into laughter.
