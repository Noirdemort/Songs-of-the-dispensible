What more exists beyond the questions I have asked? How do I discover conversations beyond small talk and big questions? When I know everything about my lover, when I’ve wondered all there was, when at the core I discovered her to be same as me and countless others - how do words hold further relevance? - Is the regular banter good enough? and does it tie to the realization that  this was all this world could offer? - Don’t actions have their own limit? - even silence too? -  What is this sense of being limited by my imagination and senses? Argh, break me out of this chain, feed me ideas unfettered by deeds - Can I just forsake words? And am I the person who can live without them?

A lover is my excuse to drop any care of self and its interests. Even when diluted in diction, what’s beyond the verbal and apparent non-verbal? Or  — Am I just broken? Am I even capable of feeling love and loving anymore?

Art is a lie to reveal the truth

Can life be known in its collection of possibilities? What if so? A life lived, becomes a plane of projection - in a certain way, a partial truth. Is this what a hive mind aspires to be - a superposition of possibilities just knowing - to wit of any context, to know what all it could have been and in realization of it? — and does that mean to create metaphysical boundaries circumferencing the limitations of the existing entity (i.e. the hive mind in this case) or the nature of universe it exists in? — is that what culmination of human endeavour looks like - a black hole of stories existing in superposition with branching at the whim and fancy of the enquiring mind — and is it possible that the very limit of those outcomes (even highly improbable ones) reveal the fundamental nature and limits of our existence? Is it just the limit of our sentience? “A restless longing to break free, a desert loneliness that follows”

How does our intent weave into this?

What if the yearning for physical senses is removed (a parallel system of sensations which are always satiated installed) and a wondering mind remains? Is it tragic - or do I feel that way due to self-preservation instincts? What will that world have to explore? Is that a sterile world?

The thinking apparatus - the intricate thought and anything related - is based on the firing of neurones, in certain sections of the brain, and having those neural pathways. If a unanimous model of neural path map is possible, then doesn’t our brain becomes like just a search engine - waiting for certain permutations to be triggered for any answer and experience? Or is there more sense of memory to our senses than we realize - like our hands remembering the embrace of a lover, her fragrance? But it all leans on the neural map and its mutually exclusive variations across the spectrum
- This is again a variation of the question if enlightenment is searchable if it’s just a permutation of words. Certainly encoded in digits of pi
