Do we witness the ubiquitous night?
Or does it perjure different truths?
Crickets warn of changing worlds and evolving desires,
Stars, like vision, twinkle timid and bright,
The breeze shields from sting of void,
Moon secedes in solitude,
The fog deceives perception,
Quaint pulse,
Unravelling breath,
A sigh of hope, 

Ever and anon, one a star will move too fast,
I turn the other way,
The grass and me, await dew
