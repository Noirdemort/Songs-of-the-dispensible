The bond between space and time. The relation of self with time, space and gravity.

Loss of time holds more gravity than spatial separation. The prison of time - realization that life moved on without you.
The search for an anchor - The easier it is to revisit that moment via memory. THAT is how we transcend time.

- Gravity can go across dimensions as well. Nolan's obsession with time. 
- Non-linear narratives and ambiguous, objective-reality, 
- epistemology (what can be known) vs ontology(what is real), 
- reality tinted by perception, memory as interpretation - not a record, who we are beyond that?
- Things that really drive us like passion and romance, the objective reality becomes much less important than our subjective inclinations
- objective reality as escape from self, seeking salvation in objective reality - and struggles when not able to establish it. Acceptance of subjective truths (belief as an option)

Focus on what we can be implied and beyond all the unreliability of our perceptions?

The democratization of potential to bring change and subsequent loss of accountability

chaos - malice - aloof - control

Business and people

High consequence unprecedented risk, the bounds of truth - a banality to predicament of things being vastly out of our grasp of understanding. A loss of feeling of security, a feeling of imposing truth

Potential turns into pressure - what could be fun turns into a compulsion - like the idea of an adventurous life. Can we have an identity without storytelling? But what we need to consider as well is adventures and stories can only be recounted by looking back in the past and in the impact they carried. Also, perfect moments (which clearly mark milestones like a kiss at end of romantic movie) are often much more muddled in reality.
Living for the experience, need for a story connects us to each other - breaking free from a need for cohesion.
