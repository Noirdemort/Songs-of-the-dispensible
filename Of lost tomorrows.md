Of lost tomorrows

I think a lot about how we as a culture have turned "forever" into the
only acceptable definition of success.

Like... if you open a coffee shop and run it for a while and it makes
you happy but then stuff gets too expensive and stressful and you
want to do something else so you close it, it's a "failed" business. If
you write a book or two, then decide that you don't actually want to
keep doing that, you're a "failed" writer. If you marry someone, and
that marriage is good for a while, and then stops working and you
get divorced, it's a "failed" marriage.

The only acceptable "win condition" is "you keep doing that thing
forever". A friendship that lasts for a few years but then its time is
done and you move on is considered less valuable or not a "real"
friendship. A hobby that you do for a while and then are done with is
a "phase" - or, alternatively, a "pity" that you don't do that thing any
more. A fandom is "dying" because people have had a lot of fun
with it but are now moving on to other things.

I just think that something can be good, and also end, and that thing
was still good. And it's okay to be sad that it ended, too. But the
idea that anything that ends is automatically less than this
hypothetical eternal state of success.. I don't think that's doing us
any good at all.
