Was he Oppenheimer because he invented the atomic bomb? Or did he invent the atomic bomb because he was Oppenheimer? Is Oppenheimer a person or a series of predicaments?

We have yet looked for free will as individuals; but extending upon the kinetic theory of gasses and inspired from Asimov's 'Psychohistory', we can perform a Copernican turn and evaluate free will from a frame of society? How will that be quantified? It is axiomatic that idea of free will and freedom emerges in often paradoxical kaleidoscope of constraints we find ourselves in - be it material, physical or intangible. Freedom and free will maybe subject to Hegelian frame - that we are our own symptom - that they may be conscious only in constraints of life. 

Kierkegaard regarded anxiety to be the dizziness of freedom; Maybe a truly free being will not be conscious of any such idea. Sure there are people which history has noted as catalysts for change, invention, revolution and so on... but what is our anxiety as a society and mankind? What is the collective free will if there can be such a thing?

Ourselves and our institutions are convened as cogs of the 'machine'. The machine is appreciating, acknowledging and propagating "cogs" in the shadow of its own good, to propagate itself - hence the light on individualism is cast only for the necessary friction system requires to keep its gears running. but to serve what purpose does the machine exist if it can churn away any and everyone to its own purpose? 

But then again, this all lies on the assumption that the system is contained with no external factors. Also, the frame of reference will change this - should we consider from a perspective of life as phenomenon, or from the perspective of intelligent life or just of human society... and there are still ton of qualifications I should be deemed to offer but feeling just as lazy to do so without someone's curiosity to unravel it. 
Still, humor me all the same! 


Mai shramik bhi hoon aur sahookar bhi
mai had bhi hoon aur anhad bhi
mai saagar hoon anant - aatur dariya mein vileen hone ko
mai intezaar hoon - intezaar na hone ka 
kyunki ant hi anant hai

no death - consuming void - dark consciousness
super position
can't have desires cause don't have destiny
entropy is the longing
life evolves and alone

The more I am thinking about it the more I am going deep in my emotions and now in this depth of sea where I can not hear any sound.... There is now a Black hole in my chest vacuuming everything LITERALLY EVERYTHING... my emotions, my courage, my tears, my smiles, my happiness, my sadness and a tons of emotions I can not reveal nor I can explain..

What if humans and life on earth exist just as a metaphor for life? A life that is more than biological
What if we have already talked about things that can be talked about and recorded it online? Will the reinterpretation of that flux of information be called 'intelligent' - after all we have always built on the shoulder of the giants?

The words aren’t even mine
Yet my deceit run through them,
My silences have bared the truths
For lies to veil over them

They will comfort you enough 
But don’t rest - o venturer
Underneath the mounds
There is a wail
- waiting to be acquainted





Time is a fiction. Like any story, I weave myself in and out of histories. Occasionally I do take the shape of a spider.

To each hour alive, for it is the keeper of our death.
