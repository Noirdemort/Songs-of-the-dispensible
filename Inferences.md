Was he Oppenheimer because he invented the atomic bomb? Or did he invent the atomic bomb because he was Oppenheimer? Is Oppenheimer a person or a series of predicaments?

We have yet looked for free will as individuals; but extending upon the kinetic theory of gasses and inspired from Asimov's 'Psychohistory', we can perform a Copernican turn and evaluate free will from a frame of society? How will that be quantified? It is axiomatic that idea of free will and freedom emerges in often paradoxical kaleidoscope of constraints we find ourselves in - be it material, physical or intangible. Freedom and free will maybe subject to Hegelian frame - that we are our own symptom - that they may be conscious only in constraints of life. 

Kierkegaard regarded anxiety to be the dizziness of freedom; Maybe a truly free being will not be conscious of any such idea. Sure there are people which history has noted as catalysts for change, invention, revolution and so on... but what is our anxiety as a society and mankind? What is the collective free will if there can be such a thing?

Ourselves and our institutions are convened as cogs of the 'machine'. The machine is appreciating, acknowledging and propagating "cogs" in the shadow of its own good, to propagate itself - hence the light on individualism is cast only for the necessary friction system requires to keep its gears running. but to serve what purpose does the machine exist if it can churn away any and everyone to its own purpose? 

But then again, this all lies on the assumption that the system is contained with no external factors. Also, the frame of reference will change this - should we consider from a perspective of life as phenomenon, or from the perspective of intelligent life or just of human society... and there are still ton of qualifications I should be deemed to offer but feeling just as lazy to do so without someone's curiosity to unravel it. 
Still, humor me all the same! 


Mai shramik bhi hoon aur sahookar bhi
mai had bhi hoon aur anhad bhi
mai saagar hoon anant - aatur dariya mein vileen hone ko
mai intezaar hoon - intezaar na hone ka 
kyunki ant hi anant hai

no death - consuming void - dark consciousness
super position
can't have desires cause don't have destiny
entropy is the longing
life evolves and alone

The more I am thinking about it the more I am going deep in my emotions and now in this depth of sea where I can not hear any sound.... There is now a Black hole in my chest vacuuming everything LITERALLY EVERYTHING... my emotions, my courage, my tears, my smiles, my happiness, my sadness and a tons of emotions I can not reveal nor I can explain..

What if humans and life on earth exist just as a metaphor for life? A life that is more than biological
What if we have already talked about things that can be talked about and recorded it online? Will the reinterpretation of that flux of information be called 'intelligent' - after all we have always built on the shoulder of the giants?

The words aren’t even mine
Yet my deceit run through them,
My silences have bared the truths
For lies to veil over them

They will comfort you enough 
But don’t rest - o venturer
Underneath the mounds
There is a wail
- waiting to be acquainted

I want this darkness and void to be me... like my body is just a shape that darkness and void has taken on earth I am formless essentially but conscious always, that way I can manipulate matter, go beyond time and defeat gravity... this allows me to exist outside realm of human limitations beyond generations with no beginning and end... I can travel to any point in universe, start another solar system like this (the controlling things part isn't as important) but most importantly know about this... stretches of existence, maybe a multiverse when I can observe this cosmos... and when these ideas become stale with time... I wanna discover and invent new ideas as I will essentially be the core of being and be able to collapse and make this cosmos exist again... This is wild but hard work as well to go beyond our banal ideas of stories


What is the photo anymore? Are we capturing only biases? What are the ones we are excepting as impositions? 
Biases are eventualities of moving ahead. We will have to lean on one of the choices at any moment - though they are usually very different for us - at least wearing on our ethnicity and different factors about us. With filters being applied and adjustments being made behind the scenes initially all good intention, but for whom is it go down the line? There is a case for customisation to the individual but then again within the biases we get to choose what are the ones we don't get to choose? what are the unfreedom we don't get to voice? The chains we don't feel binding us but still everpresent?
Then again, the bare minimum becomes the baseline of our expectations. The life in itself, not just human, is a stride with the inherent conflict. Sure as a community and species – come up with abstractions to move forward – but nothing is really right or wrong – nothing is written in stone except consequences, which are neither good, not bad without the eye of self preservation.

We want liberty for what we are – there is no better chance of self preservation. But what we are is a question in itself – and there can be no copout answers in this – it has to be evaluated comprehensively. The what and the how of manner we often describe ourselves are usually a bunch of adjectives - the really persistent one becomes a very definition. 
What is human can be described as a genome sequence and what is human is an extension of its implications. The genome sequence or the arrangement of atoms is just syntactic or maybe syntactical sugar over something more fundamental?
Beyond that, what is the semantics of one particular arrangement? And we do have arrange of them - why so many copies though? There are multiple expression of these arrangements, but how do we begin to understand or interpret one. 
There is a how and why to be answered here – there is absurdism, which chalks this up to chance – and while that is fair consolation, it's not reaching the extent of answering an affirmation or the existence of any such meaning.
Which brings me to the question: how long is now? The iota of past, and future keep flowing distinctly – a pin in our hand can point precisely, but when is now? Writing these words - halfway - are in now, but we can't say what is the present recording it?
Should present be seen as the wave passing through? Or is it the conversion of future to pass? It is departing while constantly arriving. But then again I am describing it by not describing it.
All this musing raises the curiosity, if one were to try, how can they go about recognising such an intent? Philosophy becomes speculation after an extent – more useful in sociopolitical scenario, then when investigating absolute truth. My inclination is have been towards freedom, rather than the truth, but not knowing the fundamental discretion of cosmos, leaves one to wonder – to what extent that freedom is being exercised to and for what ends. 
We are an animal and search of self appointed master and I agree with Hegel’s Copernican of objective arising within subjective/substance. Metaphysics investigates a sense of expression of self and interpretations of truth – no assurances or exams there.
The patterns and numbers may be peculiar expressions, such as pi, but we do need evidence of places when it isn't.
Even going intergalactic or becoming a level seven civilisation is an exercise. An expression of our abilities – a lot more fancy – yes, but it will only question over self constructed norms and beliefs – we need to vendor in the large and unfathomable, and the micro and the unfathomable. maybe at the principle of these three - the normal, the macro and the micro - we find some semblance of truth. Why life can be wondered over and maybe worth having an ego for, it is not truly impressive – after all, they underlies a mutual benefits for organisms to coexist for systems to have developed in certain way. The process of evolution has been much elongated and full of trial and error which continues to till day and beyond. 
A research here is to find the spa that starts at all – the trigger for all of it to be? This is not mere venture into asking – why life or why universe -that is whims I would note – but why this expression - for that is the true enquiry into the understanding why things are the way they are? Sure life evolves, but what about physics and chemistry? Did the maths come first or did the physics?
I still have to think about how that enquiry would be made? How that question of meaning be asked and found? Not of life – that can be trivial, we could be universe’s whim or expression - but what led the universe to be? And lastly, how did my friend “time” came into this?

Time is a fiction. Like any story, I weave myself in and out of histories. Occasionally I do take the shape of a spider.

To each hour alive, for it is the keeper of our death.
